# Bug-Triaging-using-Machine-learning-algorithms
Bug triaging is a concept of assigning newly reported bug to the appropriate developer. In this project a new algorithm is proposed using existing machine learning algorithm to analysis the text data of a bug repository independent of developer. An extensive analysis is done on natural language processing for analysis of text data to estimate accuracy, precision, recalls and F-score using different machine learning algorithm like SVM, Random Forest using R and python Programming.
