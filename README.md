# Bug-Triaging-using-Machine-learning-algorithms
Bug triaging is a concept of assigning newly reported bug to the appropriate developer. This task of assigning bug to developer is done by manager of the project. As number of reported bugs increases this task becomes tedious because manager should have knowledge of efficiency of all developers. In order to overcome from this problem, an automated bug triaging system is introduced using machine learning algorithm. In existing papers, it has been applied on dataset without considering developers availability to solve newly assigned bugs. In this paper a new algorithm is proposed using existing machine learning algorithm to analysis the text data of a bug repository independent of developer. An extensive analysis is done on natural language processing for analysis of text data to estimate accuracy, precision, recalls and F-score using different machine learning algorithm.
